## About
This project is intended for letting users learn about the various characters of the anime "My Hero Academia."

## Database
This project utilizes a self-crafted MySQL database of 48 entries in order to store the information on each character.

## Home Page
The user is welcomed to the application and can navigate to the four main pages: the Student Heroes page, the Pro Heroes page, the Villains page, and the quiz page.

## Student Heroes / Pro Heroes / Villains pages
Here the user is greeted with all of the student heroes/pro heroes/villains whose profiles are able to be viewed, complete with thumbnails.

## Profile pages
Upon clicking on an individual character, the user is taken to a profile page showing a picture of the individual character and unique information on them depending on whether they are a student, pro, or villain.

## Quiz page

Here the user is challenged to test their knowledge with five questions about the characters in the database. The user can input answers (case-sensitive) and will receive flash messages whether their answer is correct or not.
